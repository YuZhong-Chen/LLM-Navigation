Devcontainer
============

.. warning::

    The Devcontainer extension is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to open any folder in a container. 
    It provides full development environment isolation and allows you to develop in a containerized environment.
    If you only want to use the Dockerfile and Docker Compose, you can skip this step.

Press the link below to install the Devcontainer extension:

`Install the Devcontainer extension <vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers>`_

Or you can install it from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:
