Introduction
------------

Navigating in a previously unseen environment is a challenging task within the field of robotic learning, 
as the agent has to perform localization, mapping and path proposing in real-time. Further, 
providing an intuitive interface for the users to guide the agent, such as natural language instructions, 
can make the task more difficult. However, it is a valuable area of study. In this research, 
the agent is tasked to navigate to the specified goal location using its forward-facing RGBD image observations and a goal query provided in natural language.

Features
--------

- Automatically navigate the robot to a specific goal without any high-cost sensors.
- Based on a single camera and use deep learning methods.
- Use Sim-to-Real technology to eliminate the gap between virtual environment and real world.
- Introduce Virtual guidance to entice the agent to move toward a specific direction.
- Use Reinforcement learning to avoid obstacles while driving through crowds of people.
